Xcode4 templates for Go Projects
=============

Frustrated with Xcode 4.4 and it's lack of [Go Language](http://golang.org/) support,
I managed to hack a couple of template files that make things *a little* more bearable.

Clone this repo, and copy the Template directory in the top level to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode

Restart Xcode.

When you create a new project, you should have a new Project Type of Go under OSX and a way to create go source files.

We still have the issue of having to mark the Syntax Coloring by hand, with the stuff that is is in $GOROOT/misc/xcode/4/
